# Supermarket-Sales-Analysis

The dataset contains sales details of different stores of a supermarket chain that has multiple stores in different parts of the US.
With columns including: Ship Mode, Segment, Country, City, State, Postal code, Region, Category, Sub-category, Sales, Quantity, Discount, and Profit.

Dataset source: Kaggle(public).

This dataset was analyzed in 2 parts: Power BI and MongoDB.

## 1. Power BI

The dataset was cleaned and prepared for analysis. Followed by the implementation of stacked bar charts, pie charts, co-relation sketch, map chart, and card implementation of key attributes connected to sales and profit. Later, a collective dashboard was developed based on all the generated reports highlighting the key factors leading to sales. For the same, filters were applied for selective display and slicers were defined where necessary.

Top conclusions from the dashboard:

1.1. 31.5% of the sales revenue is generated from west-America, particularly, California being the highest contributor. Followed by 29.5% of sales revenue being generated from east-America wherein New York was the highest contributor. Discounts can be offered to customers of this region to increase sales and improve the membership counts.

1.2. 59.2% of the customers prefer standard shipping method, thus the cost of other shipping methods could be an issue of not being much popular. Also, this implies that if there are some customers who require urgent stuffs they might prefer any other shopping store with less price and quicker shipping method.

1.3. Maximum profit is earned on each technology product being sold, thus periodic sales could be arranged on technology products as the net margin in case of sale would also lead to profit.

1.4. Consumer segment has contributed the most to sales in terms of $1.16M revenue. Thus the prime focus of the store must be on these customers.
